# Helper file to deploy your frontend Angular application to a Docker container enabled server.
# Use Docker to first build the "Dockerfile" found in the same folder as this file, then make
# sure you upload your Docker image to for instance Docker HUB, or some other place that allows
# you to share Docker images.

# As you upload your image, it's important you use servergardens/babelfish as its organisation/name.
# When your image is uploaded, you can use this file to deploy your frontend, for then to setup a
# DNS A record for babelfish.servergardens.com and point it to the public IP address of your server.

# This file will automatically generate an SSL certificate for you, and secure your website,
# using whatever backend you used when you crudified your frontend.
